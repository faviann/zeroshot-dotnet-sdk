# SDK run handles

`ZeroshotClient` prepares and submits requests, runs them to completion, and opens exact known runs for
status, waiting, force-stop, watch, logs or live attachment. It uses one `NativeClient` for every native call; direct `NativeClient` use
needs none of the SDK's binding, waiting or recovery policy.

```csharp
await using var zeroshot = new ZeroshotClient(new ZeroshotClientOptions
{
    Target = new Uri("https://target.example/"),
    NativeBinding = NativeBinding.CallerSupplied("10.10.0", "3ee1192cec359a0b997f464e703a936e8b67d63c"),
});

RunResult done = await zeroshot.RunAsync(request, runCredentials, timeout: null, ct); // submit, then wait
Run submitted = await zeroshot.SubmitAsync(request, runCredentials, ct);    // acknowledged run, or throws
RunResult result = await submitted.WaitAsync(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30), ct); // optional observation budget
RunResult stopped = await submitted.ForceStopAsync(timeout: null, ct);     // one force, then wait if needed

PreparedSubmission prepared = RunRequest.ParseUtf8(requestBytes).Prepare(); // or zeroshot.Prepare(request)
Run run = zeroshot.GetRun(knownRunId);                                      // no I/O
RunStatusResult status = await run.StatusAsync(ct);
if (RunResult.FromStatus(status) is { } reported) reported.EnsureSuccess();

await File.WriteAllTextAsync("run.json", run.Reference.ToJson(), ct);
Run reopened = zeroshot.GetRun(RunReference.Parse(await File.ReadAllTextAsync("run.json", ct)));

await foreach (RunAttachEventNotification output in run.AttachAsync(executionId, ct))
    Show(output);
```

Wrap an existing client with `new ZeroshotClient(native, binding, ownsClient: false)`.
Construction, preparation and `GetRun` perform no network I/O. Disposal never stops a run.
The SDK uses target-wide OECP sessions on direct and private targets. Hosted run
workflows stay with the lower client's `HostedRuns` operations.

## Dependency injection

`AddZeroshotClient` registers a singleton `ZeroshotClient` and the singleton `NativeClient` it uses:

```csharp
services.AddZeroshotClient(new ZeroshotClientOptions { Target = target, NativeBinding = binding });
services.AddZeroshotClient(sp => new ZeroshotClientOptions                       // the factory runs once
{
    Target = sp.GetRequiredService<Settings>().Target, NativeBinding = binding,
});
```

Both use the SDK's own transport; `IHttpClientFactory` and supplied `HttpClient`s do not apply. The container
disposes both clients. Disposal never stops a run.

## Requests and preparation

`RunRequest` holds title, graph, runtime, initial input and exact source, plus optional
environment, `RunId` and `SubmissionKey`. `ParseUtf8` reads the native submission fields
(with `submissionKey` optional) and an optional `runId`, and rejects unknown or duplicate
fields and invalid native values. `Prepare()` generates an omitted run ID as a canonical
UUIDv7 and an omitted key as `dotnet-` plus 32 lowercase hex digits, then fixes the
retained bytes through `PreparedSubmission.Create`. Each call prepares new work;
supplied identities are never replaced. Omitted, null and present environments stay
distinct.

## Submission

Both forms send the fixed `POST /native-v2/run` once through the lower
`Target.SubmitAttemptAsync`, with the exact prepared bytes plus separately supplied
`TargetRunCredentials` (an empty connection map by default) and the client's
`TargetCredentials`. Neither form retries, regenerates identity or persists anything.

```csharp
// Ordinary: prepares internally, so omitted identity is generated for this call only.
Run run = await zeroshot.SubmitAsync(request, runCredentials, ct);

// Advanced: fix and retain the request first; later import it and send exactly those bytes.
PreparedSubmission prepared = zeroshot.Prepare(request);
await store.SaveAsync(prepared.ExportUtf8(), ct);
PreparedSubmission retained = PreparedSubmission.ImportUtf8(await store.ReadAsync(ct));
TargetSubmissionAttempt attempt = await zeroshot.SubmitAttemptAsync(retained, runCredentials, ct);
```

`SubmitAttemptAsync` returns the lower attempt: `Acknowledged`, `Rejected`, `NotSent` or
`Unknown`, with `Prepared`, `ProposedRunId`, `AcknowledgedRunId`, `RunIdsMatch`,
correlation ID and safe `Failure` evidence, including cancellation. Classification is the
lower client's: only pinned admission refusals are rejections, while `503
target.unavailable`, malformed or oversized replies, transport loss, and deadlines or
cancellation after possible dispatch stay unknown; a deadline or cancellation before
dispatch is `NotSent`. A captured valid acknowledgement wins a
racing cancellation or cleanup failure.

`SubmitAsync` has `RunRequest` and `PreparedSubmission` overloads over that same attempt.
It returns a `Run` for the acknowledged ID, which can differ from the proposed ID; the
handle's `Submission` keeps the attempt, so a caller can apply a stricter identity policy.
A mismatch is not proof of deduplication. Any other outcome throws with the attempt:

- `SubmissionCanceledException`, an `OperationCanceledException` carrying the token that
  cancelled the attempt (`NotSent` or `Unknown`): the caller's, or the native client's
  lifetime when that client is disposed mid-flight;
- `SubmissionException` otherwise, with the native failure as its inner exception.

The attempt holds the prepared request, including identity generated by the ordinary
overload, so a caller can retain it and replay it explicitly. An unknown outcome may still
have created a run. A missing or mismatched binding is a `NotSent` attempt whose `Failure`
is the `NativeBindingException`, so `SubmitAsync` throws `SubmissionException` with it as
the inner exception. Invalid arguments and disposal throw before anything is sent, for both
forms. `GetRun` handles have no `Submission`.

## Native binding and run references

A `NativeBinding` is the caller's declaration of the target's native build. Native
publishes no build identity, so the binding is labelled `caller-supplied` and never
reported as remote attestation. Before each run operation, the SDK refuses with a
`NativeBindingException` (inside a `NotSent` attempt for submission) with:

- `Missing` when the client has no binding;
- `Mismatched` when the binding is not native 10.10.0 at `3ee1192c…`, or when a reopened
  reference's binding differs from the client's.

Neither case dispatches anything. Discovery and every other `NativeClient` call stay
available. `run.Reference` throws `Missing` when there is no binding to record.

A `RunReference` is the exact target, run ID and binding, with no credentials or history:

```json
{"schema":"zeroshot-dotnet/run-reference/v1","target":"https://target.example/","runId":"…","nativeBinding":{"provenance":"caller-supplied","release":"10.10.0","sourceRevision":"3ee1192cec359a0b997f464e703a936e8b67d63c"}}
```

`Parse` accepts exactly these fields. `GetRun(reference)` rejects a different target; it
never retargets or adopts the reference's binding.

## Status and results

`StatusAsync` returns the complete native `RunStatusResult`, including a failed run.
`RunResult.FromStatus` returns null until the run is finished, then gives `IsSuccess`,
generic JSON `Output` (a JSON null for a successful null output, C# null only on failure),
`FailureReason`, native `Metadata` and `Evidence`. Status yields
`TerminalEvidenceKind.StatusReport` with the status cursor. Native can report a status-only
terminal failure without a durable event, so this is distinct from
`RetainedTerminalEvent`, which only `WaitAsync` produces, from a terminal watch record and its cursor. Neither kind
proves retained completion or physical cessation. `EnsureSuccess()` throws
`RunFailedException` carrying the result.

## Waiting

`run.WaitAsync(timeout, ct)` returns the run's `RunResult`; a failed run is a result, not an
exception. It reads status and returns an already reported terminal result. Otherwise it watches
from that status's cursor, with the recovery described under [Watch and logs](#watch-and-logs),
and returns the first terminal watch record as `RetainedTerminalEvent` evidence. If the watch
ends normally without one, it reads status once more and returns a reported terminal result as
`StatusReport` evidence, which is how native's status-only `runtime_failed` fallback appears. A
nonterminal final status is incomplete observation: the end of a stream is never success.

`timeout` is `null` by default: the wait lasts until the run finishes or the caller cancels. A
finite budget covers every status read, watch setup, reopen delay and recovery; per-operation
timeouts cannot extend it. `TimeSpan.Zero` performs no observation and times out at once.
Negative or `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan` values throw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`; `null` is
the only indefinite spelling. A quiet run is never failed for silence.

A wait that ends without a result throws with the exact `Run` and `RunWaitEvidence`: the latest
validated `Status`, the latest delivered watch record (`LastEvent`) and the `ResumeAfter`
checkpoint, each possibly null.

| Exception | Kind | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RunWaitTimeoutException` | `Timeout` | The budget expired |
| `RunWaitException` | `Status` | A status read failed, including malformed status |
| `RunWaitException` | `Observation` | The watch failed; the inner `RunObservationException` has the reason |
| `RunWaitException` | `Incomplete` | The watch ended normally and the final status was not terminal |
| `RunWaitCanceledException` | | Caller cancellation (an `OperationCanceledException`), or disposal of the client |

None of these is a claim about the run's outcome. Timeout, cancellation and disposal detach the
observation and never send force; the run continues. A missing or mismatched binding throws
`NativeBindingException` before any I/O.

`zeroshot.RunAsync(request or prepared, credentials, timeout, ct)` validates `timeout`, submits
once as `SubmitAsync` does, and then waits. Submission failures throw `SubmissionException` or
`SubmissionCanceledException` as before. The wait budget starts after acknowledgement and bounds
observation only; it is not a native run deadline. Every wait exception carries the acknowledged
`Run`, so `Run.Submission` survives a later timeout, failure or cancellation, including a
cancellation that races the acknowledgement.

## Force-stop

`run.ForceAttemptAsync(ct)` sends one native `run/force` for the exact run over the control
connection and returns the lower `NativeAttempt<RunForceResult>`: `Acknowledged` with the
returned status, `Rejected`, `NotSent` or `Unknown`, with correlation ID and safe `Failure`
evidence, including cancellation. Classification is the lower client's: only pinned
pre-effect refusals are rejections, and a lost reply, malformed reply or cancellation after
possible dispatch is `Unknown`. It never retries or waits. A missing or mismatched binding,
or a failure to open the control connection, is `NotSent`. Calling it on a disposed client
throws `ObjectDisposedException`. Disposing the client during the attempt ends it as `NotSent`
while the control connection is still opening, or as `Unknown` once the request may have been
sent, because disposal closes that connection.

`run.ForceStopAsync(timeout, ct)` validates `timeout`, makes that one attempt, and then:

- returns the terminal result already in the acknowledgement (`RunResult.FromForce`, with
  `StatusReport` evidence at the acknowledgement's cursor), without observing; or
- after an acknowledged nonterminal status such as `stopping`, waits exactly as
  `WaitAsync(timeout, ct)` does. The budget starts after acknowledgement.

An unacknowledged attempt throws `ForceStopException`, or `ForceStopCanceledException` (an
`OperationCanceledException`) when the attempt's failure is a cancellation, each carrying the
`Run` and the `Attempt`. The canceled exception has the caller's token when the caller
cancelled. Disposal while force is pending is usually `ForceStopException` with an `Unknown`
attempt. An `Unknown` attempt may
still have stopped the run. Once acknowledged, every later wait exception
(`RunWaitTimeoutException`, `RunWaitException`, `RunWaitCanceledException`) carries it as
`ForceAttempt` together with the wait's latest `Evidence`, including when cancellation lands
just after the acknowledgement is captured or the client is disposed during the wait.
Force is never resent, and timeout, cancellation and disposal never send force. An
acknowledgement records native stop intent; neither it nor a `force_stopped` result claims
physical cessation.

### A deadline across precheck, force and observation

`ForceStopAsync`'s timeout covers only observation after acknowledgement, and the force
request keeps its own finite request timeout. A caller with a total stop budget, such as
Broodling's retirement, composes the separate APIs under its own deadline instead:

```csharp
var elapsed = Stopwatch.StartNew();
using var stop = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(ct);
stop.CancelAfter(totalBudget);

RunStatusResult current = await run.StatusAsync(stop.Token);            // intended-ID and phase precheck
if (RunResult.FromStatus(current) is { } already) return already;
NativeAttempt<RunForceResult> attempt = await run.ForceAttemptAsync(stop.Token);
await store.RecordStopAttemptAsync(attempt);                             // yours: Unknown needs your policy
if (attempt.Response is not { } acknowledgement) return Unresolved(attempt); // never resend automatically
if (RunResult.FromForce(acknowledgement) is { } terminal) return terminal;
var remaining = totalBudget - elapsed.Elapsed;
return await run.WaitAsync(remaining > TimeSpan.Zero ? remaining : TimeSpan.Zero, stop.Token);
```

The linked token bounds the precheck and force request. Passing the remaining time as the
wait's `timeout` makes the wait end at the same deadline with `RunWaitTimeoutException`, or
`RunWaitCanceledException` when the token fires first; both carry the latest evidence, and a
zero remainder times out without observing. Authorization, intended-ID policy, handling an unknown
effect and retaining the attempt stay with the caller.

## Watch and logs

`run.WatchAsync` and `run.LogsAsync` replay retained history and then follow it live until
native closes the stream. Each yields `HistoryRecord<T>`: the complete native notification
(`RunWatchEventNotification` or `RunLogEventNotification`, with subscription ID, run, cursor
and data) and its `HistoryCheckpoint`.

```csharp
HistoryCheckpoint? after = await store.LoadCheckpointAsync(ct);   // yours; null starts from the beginning
await foreach (var record in run.LogsAsync(execution: null, after, ct))
{
    await ProcessAsync(record.Event, ct);
    await store.SaveCheckpointAsync(record.Checkpoint.ToJson(), ct); // after processing, not on receipt
}
```

A checkpoint is the opaque cursor plus its scope: target, run, stream kind and, for logs,
the execution filter (null is run-wide). Passing a checkpoint from another scope throws
`ArgumentException` before any I/O. `ToJson`/`Parse` use
`zeroshot-dotnet/history-checkpoint/v1` and accept exactly the exported fields. Replay is
exclusive: the checkpoint's own record is not repeated. Durable processing checkpoints are
the caller's; resuming from an older one repeats records, and nothing is exactly-once.
A normal end is native `done` for that stream, never run completion.

Each enumeration opens its own connection. After an established stream is interrupted by
disconnection, unexpected EOF or remote `SLOW_CONSUMER`, records already validated and
queued are delivered first. The SDK then waits `ReopenDelay` (250 ms, cancellable) and
reopens exclusively after the last record it yielded. It never resumes from a received,
buffered or server-reported (`lastDeliveredCursor`) position, and a watch keeps the source of
the first delivered record. Recovery repeats for as long as the enumeration stays active. Every
(re)establishment has one `SetupTimeout` budget (30 s) covering discovery, session, connect,
initialize and subscription. Set `ObservationOptions.Recover = false` to receive the
interruption instead. Configure these through `ZeroshotClientOptions.Observation` or the
`observation` argument when wrapping an existing `NativeClient`.

Other endings throw `RunObservationException`, whose `Kind` is:

| Kind | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Establishment` | Initial or reopened setup failed or exceeded its budget (inner `TimeoutException`); never retried |
| `Interrupted` | An eligible interruption with recovery disabled |
| `SourceUnavailable` | Native `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`; retained history is incomplete and retrying the cursor cannot heal it |
| `Protocol` | Malformed or foreign data, including a different run, execution or source |
| `ResourceLimit` | A local queue or message size limit |

`ResumeAfter` is the last delivered record's checkpoint, else the starting checkpoint, else
null; `Recoveries` counts reopen attempts. The inner exception keeps the native failure.
Caller cancellation throws `OperationCanceledException`, and ending, cancelling or disposing
the enumeration sends `subscription/cancel`. Observation never sends force or resubmits.
Queues stay bounded by the native client's per-stream and aggregate limits during recovery.

## Connections

Status and force use one lazily opened control connection per `ZeroshotClient`. The next
operation reopens it after a failure; the failed call is not retried. Initialize, status
and force use reserved control request capacity. Each `AttachAsync` enumeration opens its
own connection and live attachment, which it closes when enumeration ends. Cancelling
or disposing an open attachment also sends `subscription/cancel`. It never sends force,
reopens or replays; a new enumeration is a new live view.

Every `ZeroshotClient` keeps one of the native client's `MaxOecpConnections` for control.
SDK observations (attachment, watch and logs) are admitted only while the connections left
over remain, and a watch or log enumeration keeps its slot across reopens, so neither
concurrent observation setup nor several SDK clients sharing one `NativeClient` can take
a control connection. Connections opened directly on a shared `NativeClient` count against
the same limit and remain the caller's responsibility. Request slots are only partly
separated: every connection's initialize draws on the reserved control slots, and
reopening the control connection runs discovery and connect as ordinary requests. With
SDK-only traffic at the default limits, observation setup on at most 17 connections cannot
exhaust the 32 request slots.
